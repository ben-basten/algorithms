# CS422 - Algorithms

A compilation of all of the assignments done for the NMU algorithms course.

*Assignment Details:*

 - 2-sorting-performance: getting the average run times of a bubble sort and a merge sort with various sample sizes to prove the big O notation of each. Bubble Sort is O(n^2) and Mergesort is O(nlogn).

 - 3-karatsuba-multiplication: multiplying 2 numbers of up to infinitely large length means that built-in multiplication operators for ints and longs cannot be used. This project solves this issue by performing multiplication with both grade-school multiplication and Karatsuba's algorithm to demonstrate the different run times of each. Grade-school is O(n^2) and Karatsuba is O(n^log3)
